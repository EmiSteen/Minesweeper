# Minesweeper

Personal procrastination project I started instead of studying for exams.

Activate Speed Flag mode for left clicks to flag covered tiles and dig around revealed tiles and right clicks dig covered tiles. Ideal mode for mac or laptop users.

Set devMode = true in BoardGUI class to display hidden bombs while playing game.
