# Minesweeper

Personal procrastination project I started instead of studying for 2nd year, 1st semester exams. I developed a fixation with minesweeper as a procrastination tool, so I decided to make my own minesweeper game.

Activate Speed Flag mode for left clicks to flag covered tiles and dig around revealed tiles and right clicks dig covered tiles. Ideal mode for mac or laptop users.

Set devMode = true in BoardGUI class to display hidden bombs while playing game.
